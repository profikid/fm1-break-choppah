# CHOPPAH: notes for Claude sessions

Firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1 (JieLi AC791N): an Amen break chopper. Spec: `docs/PRD.md` (feature IDs A-*, B-*,
E-*, N-*; milestones M0–M8). Keep the PRD in step when scope changes.

## Layout

`app/app.c` is the core (settings, patterns, MIDI, the render); it ends by including `app/ui/*.c` in order (common,
fx, pads, keys, bta, global, seq, kick, perc, mixer, screen, main): one unity build, so a page file sees what the
files before it define. `app/dsp/*.c` are separate `o2` units (brk, brk_fx, kick, perc, …).

## Hard rules

- `app/dsp/` stays platform-free: no `plat_*`, no fm1-base headers, no libc beyond `<stdint.h>`. It must build with
  plain `cc` (tests/engine) and as fm1-base `o2` units.
- **No double precision** anywhere in `app/` (the device build rejects it): `f` suffix on every float literal,
  no `math.h` in dsp (use `brk_math.h`). `tests/engine/run.sh` builds with `-Wdouble-promotion -Werror`.
- No 64-bit division on the device (no libgcc `__udivdi3`): keep sample maths in 32 bits.
- The render (`app_render`, `brk_render`) runs in the audio interrupt: no flash writes, no blocking, no
  allocation. Main loop → render through `brk_*` setters (single words) and the key queue.
- Pool RAM budget (PRD 8.2): canvas 240×60 (28 KB) + PCM buffers + the Bluetooth audio queue; the build wants 8 KB
  of the 344 KB spare.
- Flash writes stall audio: only on SAVE or while stopped.
- Settings (`settings_t`, magic CHP7) only grow at the end: append new fields after the last one (`perc`) and
  give them defaults in `settings_defaults()`; a shorter (older) save loads into the front (`SET_SIZE_MIN`).
  Anything else needs a new magic (saves lost). Patterns are their own object (`OBJ_PAT`, 0xDA000, magic PAT1).
- Bluetooth MIDI is on (`ble = true`, `ble_stack = "own"`: fm1-base's own stack, nothing of JieLi's); the GLOBAL
  page switches it, `APP_BLE_AT_BOOT` follows the saved setting. It costs ~40 KB of flash. Bluetooth audio out
  (`bt_audio = true`, A2DP) is on too: ~37 KB of flash, its packet queue in the pool (`BP_MQ_ATTR` in app.h).
- Flash: ~552 KB of the 581 KB app slot (`APP_SYS_TEXT` in app.h draws the platform's screens in CHOPPAH's faces,
  saving fm1-base's fonts): check `./build.sh`'s image line;
  the canvas is 240×60 (`APP_CANVAS_PX`), so draw in strips of ≤ 60 rows (draw_fx / draw_key draw two bands).
- Breaks: `breaks/breaks.txt` (paths relative to `breaks/`) marks with `*` the WAVs built into the firmware;
  `./build.sh` regenerates `app/bank_data.h` (never commit it, never edit it). The bank has 400 KB (`IMAGE_CAPACITY`
  in `tools/prep_breaks.py`) and 16 slots, a break at most `CH_PCM_MAX` 106,496 samples (pool ~326 of 344 KB). The breaks are the bank's only: brk_synth is the no-bank fallback (and
  the tests'). No loading of samples of your own (dropped from scope), and the breaks stay 2 bars (32 steps).
- Releases are automatic: every push to main is the last `vX.Y` tag + 1 minor (`scripts/next_version.sh`, floor
  `VERSION`). Don't tag by hand or bump `VERSION` for a minor; raise `VERSION` only for a new major.

## Site

`base/tools/make_site.py` builds the GitHub Pages site; `tools/site_style.py` then gives it CHOPPAH's look
(`app/site/site.css`; the installer, fm1-base's page, also `app/site/install.css`: only its style, never its markup
or ids) and puts the interactive control map (`app/site/controlmap.html`) into the manual's section
"The control map". When a page's controls change, update that file's `PAGES` list with the manual. Manual screenshots
come from the host scenarios (`app/build/scenarios/*.png`, copied into `app/docs/img`).

## Commands

```
./build.sh test        # engine tests (fast, run after every dsp change)
./build.sh             # firmware (needs scripts/bootstrap.sh, Docker/OrbStack on macOS)
./build.sh --host      # host simulator
./build.sh flash       # macOS Terminal only: the sandboxed shell has no USB access
```
